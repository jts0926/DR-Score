# DR Score: Deep-Learning Radiomics for Knee OA Progression

This repository provides the official implementation of the **DR Score**, a continuous imaging biomarker derived from knee radiographs to assess osteoarthritis severity and predict progression risk.  
The model generates a **0–4 DR Score** from a single X-ray using a Spatial–Representational kNN Attention MIL framework.

## Features
- Automated DR Score from a single radiograph  
- Attention-based MIL with survival prediction  
- Training pipeline (MOST + OAI)  
- External evaluation (MenTOR, KICK)  
- Lightweight script for daily inference
